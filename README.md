# Areas Contract

## Overview
The Areas Contract is a smart contract implemented in Cadence for use on the Flow blockchain. It is designed to demonstrate the principles of access control, resource management, and contract interaction. This contract is a great example for learning and understanding how to structure and interact with smart contracts in Cadence.

## Features
- **Structured Data Management**: Utilizes structures (`SomeStruct`) and resources (`SomeResource`) to manage data effectively.
- **Access Control**: Demonstrates various levels of access control (`pub`, `pub(set)`, `access(contract)`, `access(self)`) for variables and functions.
- **Functionality Segmentation**: Divided into different areas to illustrate scope and accessibility in different contract contexts.

## Areas in the Contract
1. **AREA 1**: Inside `SomeStruct`'s `structFunc`. Demonstrates full access within the structure's context.
2. **AREA 2**: Inside `SomeResource`'s `resourceFunc`. Shows access limitations when interacting with a resource.
3. **AREA 3**: Inside `SomeContract`'s `questsAreFun` function. Illustrates contract-level access and restrictions.
4. **AREA 4**: In a script importing `SomeContract`. Represents external, read-only access to the contract's public elements.

## Getting Started
To use this contract:
1. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the contract to the Flow blockchain.
2. **Interact with the Contract**: Utilize Flow's transaction and script capabilities to interact with the contract's functions and access its variables according to their defined scopes.

## Usage Guidelines
- Understand the access control rules of Cadence for effective interaction.
- Ensure compliance with the contract's access restrictions when attempting to read or modify variables or call functions.
